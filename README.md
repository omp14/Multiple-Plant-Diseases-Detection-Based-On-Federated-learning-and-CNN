# Multiple-Plant-Diseases-Detection-Based-On-Federated-learning-and-CNN
The goal of the project is to identify plant diseases using deep learning and federated learning
models. Plant diseases significantly reduce agricultural productivity and cause financial
losses. Traditional illness detection techniques are time-consuming and less accurate. The
suggested methodology blends federated learning with deep learning models, notably
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to address these issues. Federated learning preserves
privacy and lowers communication costs by enabling many participants to jointly train a
model without disclosing sensitive information. Plant health and illness are classified based
on image analysis using the CNN model. For training and testing, the Plant Village dataset is
used, which includes pictures of diverse plant species with various illnesses. The outcomes
show how well the suggested method works for precisely identifying plant diseases. The
research project also solves the problems with typical cloud-based deep learning techniques'
high processing costs and heterogeneous data sets. The suggested methodology enables
effective and precise identification of plant diseases while ensuring data privacy by dividing
the training process across several devices.
